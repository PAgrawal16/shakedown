## Installation

Given a Python 3.4 + pip + git environment,

`git clone github.com:mesosphere/shakedown.git && cd shakedown && pip install -e .`


## Usage

`shakedown --dcos-url=http://dcos.example.com [options] [path_to_tests]`

- `--dcos-url` is required.

- arguments can be stored in a `~/.shakedown` [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file (command-line takes precedence)
- `shakedown --help` is your friend.

## Example running all User Acceptance Tests
